## Gradle
- Build automation and dependency management tool
- Realistically almost any application we write requires Java libraries and code written by someone else
    - Trying to manually incorporate these external libraries in your application is very tedious
- Gradle is written in a programming language called Groovy
    - It is not a popular programming language
    - But it does have some really cool syntax
- The main file for any gradle project is the ***build.gradle***
    - It is in here where we will include any dependencies and isntruction on how to build the project
- src
    - Main
        -Java
            - This is where we put our Java application code
        - Resources
            - Put any files that your program needs that is *not* Java
    - Test
        -Java
            - This is where we put our Java testing code
        - Resources
            - Put any files that your program needs that is *not* Java
